      'During my time at Kewaunee, I regularly met with the sales team to understand what data, reports, and dashboards would best support their decision-making or resolve any present issues. In one of these discussions, the VP of Sales proposed a complex dashboard that would track projects set to expire across multiple timelines - within the next day, week, month, and year - along with many additional components. From a technical standpoint, I immediately recognized a major challenge: the structure he wanted conflicted with limitations in the analytics platform we were using. While it appeared unlikely that the dashboard could be built as requested, I chose not to push back. I took full ownership of the problem and committed to finding a solution. After extensive trial and error, deep research, and experimentation, I eventually identified a workaround that allowed the required data to be structured and displayed correctly. By leveraging available tools, collaborating with colleagues and supervisors, and using AI to accelerate problem-solving, I was able to successfully develop and deliver the dashboard. What began as a seemingly infeasible request became a fully functional executive tool, reinforcing my approach to problem-solving: persistence, adaptability, and a refusal to accept defeat.',

      'It was May 2023, and I was heading to Rock Hill, SC to promote my apparel business and sell t-shirts. My friend who usually ran the table with me was out of town, so I brought in another friend with sales experience to help. The tournament ran Friday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. While Friday went well, on Saturday morning, my partner woke up with a high fever and had to sit out the rest of the weekend. I considered going back, packing everything up, and leaving, but I decided to keep the table running. I knew it would be less efficient with very few breaks, since I would be handling everything myself: tracking orders, managing inventory, attracting customers, printing designs, processing transactions, and packing all equipment into my Honda Accord. I stayed and ran the table the rest of the weekend to the best of my ability. After paying the tournament owner and deducting costs, I generated just over $1,500 across Saturday and Sunday. I could have taken the easy route and left, but I chose to stay and see how well I could perform under pressure.',

      'Projects like Propify reflect the way I like to work: build with structure, think through user experience, protect what is proprietary, and create systems that can realistically scale into something bigger than a class assignment or demo. The idea for Propify came from my interest in AI and sports. As I was learning more about AI and what it is capable of, I started thinking about its potential for product creation. As a big sports fan with friends and family members who place wagers on games, I thought to myself, there has to be a better way to sports bet. Instead of relying on emotion or biased decisions with poor odds, I believed data could be used to estimate outcomes more accurately. I researched existing tools and found that while many platforms provide statistics and insights, none offer a clear, engine-generated probability for whether an event will occur. That gap led me to build my own solution. I created a Streamlit app using the nba_api to pull player data and developed an internal engine to calculate probabilities based on key performance factors and distributions. The goal was to turn raw data into a structured, usable percentage that supports more logical decision-making. From a curious thought, came an analytics platform and decision engine from scratch. It is incredible how far your mind can take you in a short amount of time.',
